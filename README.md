# CS-303-Assignment-3
#Infix-to-Postfix &amp; Queue
Program starts with infix to postfix and prompts for an expression to convert. 
It'll continue prompting for expressions until the user hits the enter key.
Then it'll display an integer queue and a double queue readily made in the main Assignment 3.cpp
displaying several of the different methods. A template was used so it should work with different
data types, it would just require creating that type of queue in the main cpp.
